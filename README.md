# Path-Finder-AI
This project focuses on the development of an interactive A* pathfinding visualization tool leveraging Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the heapq module for efficient priority queue management. The primary objective is to provide a hands-on learning platform that demonstrates the core concepts of heuristic-based search algorithms used in artificial intelligence and robotics.



The application architecture is built around a grid-based environment, where users can visually configure start and end points, place obstacles, and initiate the A* algorithm to find the optimal path in real-time. The tool highlights key steps of the algorithm, including node exploration, open/closed list behavior, and final path construction, offering a transparent view into the decision-making process of A*.



Designed and tested in a lightweight Python environment, the system emphasizes clarity, responsiveness, and educational value. It delivers an intuitive interface where users can interact with the algorithm step-by-step and observe how different inputs affect the outcome.



This visualization system demonstrates the power of Python in simulating intelligent behaviors and serves as a foundational stepping stone toward more advanced AI implementations, such as pathfinding with dynamic obstacles, terrain cost weighting, or multi-agent navigation. The project bridges the gap between algorithm theory and practical application, making it a valuable tool for students, educators, and developers exploring pathfinding and GUI development.
